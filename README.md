# Tesla_Text_Mining
In this project which was also my MSc thesis, I've worked on text mining models to forecast the Tesla stock price movement over a specified period of time.

## Usage
stock price forecasting has been recognized as one of the most challenging activities in finance. The price of financial assets is non-linear, dynamic and irregular. Therefore, it is very difficult to form financial time series and predict them. The share price is affected by many factors such as the company's fundamental parameters, company events, political and social situations and human psychology, which complicates the analysis of financial markets. In the meantime, deep learning models are one of the latest available techniques for predicting stock prices, which have a high ability to recognize complex patterns in different fields. The purpose of this paper is to present a hybrid approach by considering different deep learning techniques to predict the stock market by examining the impact of news. In this regard, news data related to the shares of Tesla Motors Company have been collected from reliable news websites for 11 months since the beginning of 2020, and using the FinBERT model (an extension of the BERT model), the effect of this news on the movement of the stock price of this company has been investigated. Furthermore, using this model, a mechanism for predicting the price of Tesla shares has been presented. The results of this research showed that the accuracy of this model, which is based on deep learning concepts, is higher than the traditional models.
